##  Job Portal for Persons with Disabilities (PWD)
### Project Overview
The Job Portal for Persons with Disabilities (PWD) is a web application designed to connect employers with qualified candidates from the PWD community, including the hearing impaired. This platform is built with inclusivity and accessibility at its core, providing resources such as job listings with accessibility features, interview scheduling with sign language interpreters, and a user-friendly interface for both employers and job seekers.
